# Pure JavaScript To Do App

This project was originally written in jQuery, but I wanted to familiarize myself with jQuery while also strengthening the knowledge I have with JavaScript, so I wrote the jQuery functions to just long and painful raw JavaScript functions. 

http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/ was actually a pretty good resource to help in this endeavor, but not all solutions were found here.

This exercise really put my critical thinking to use, and I hate to admit it took a lot longer than it should have.
