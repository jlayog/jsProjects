#Pure JavaScript To Do App

You may ask "Jerel, why didn't you just use jQuery to make this easier?"

Well, I'll tell you random onlooker in my github -- this project was originally done in jQuery, but I wanted to familiarize myself with jQuery while also strengthening the knowledge I have with JavaScript, so I translated(is that the right term? maybe) the jQuery functions to just long and painful JavaScript functions. http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/ was actually a pretty good resource to help in this endeavor, but not all functions were found here.

This exercise really put my critical thinking to use, and I hate to admit it took a lot longer than it should have.
